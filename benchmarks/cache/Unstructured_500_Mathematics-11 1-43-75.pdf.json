  "v A mathematician knows how to solve a problem,\n\nhe can not solve it. – MILNE v\n\n3.1 Introduction\n\nThe word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words\n\n‘ trigon ’ and ‘ metron ’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of\n\na triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve\n\ngeometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by\n\nsea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new\n\nlands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is\n\nused in many areas such as the science of seismology,\n\ndesigning electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,\n\npredicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a\n\nmusical tone and in many other areas.\n\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric\n\nratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right\n\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of\n\ntrigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this\n\nChapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions\n\nand study their properties.\n\n3.2 Angles\n\nAngle is a measure of rotation of a given ray about its initial point. The original ray is\n\nChapter 3\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS\n\nArya Bhatt\n\n(476-550)\n\nFig 3.1\n\nVertex\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n44\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\ncalled the initial side and the final position of the ray after rotation is called the\n\nterminal side of the angle. The point of rotation is called the vertex . If the direction of\n\nrotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation\n\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).\n\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of\n\nrotation performed to get the terminal side from\n\nthe initial side. There are several units for",
  "measuring angles. The definition of an angle\n\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as\n\nindicated in Fig 3.2.\n\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly\n\nspinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall describe\n\ntwo other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.\n\ndegree measure and radian measure.\n\n3.2.1 Degree measure If a rotation from the initial side to terminal side is\n\nth\n\n1\n\n360\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n of\n\na revolution, the angle is said to have a measure of one degree , written as 1°. A degree is\n\ndivided into 60 minutes, and a minute is divided into 60 seconds . One sixtieth of a degree is\n\ncalled a minute , written as 1 ′ , and one sixtieth of a minute is called a second , written as 1 ″ .\n\nThus,\n\n1° = 60 ′,\n\n1 ′ = 60 ″\n\nSome of the angles whose measures are 360°,180°, 270°, 420°, – 30°, – 420° are\n\nshown in Fig 3.3.\n\nFig 3.2\n\nFig 3.3\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 45\n\n3.2.2 Radian measure There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called\n\nthe radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a\n\nunit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig\n\n3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the\n\nangles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 1 1\n\n2 radian and –1 1\n\n2 radian.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\nFig 3.4 (i) to (iv)\n\n(iv)\n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2 π . Thus, one\n\ncomplete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of 2 π radian.\n\nMore generally, in a circle of radius r , an arc of length r will subtend an angle of\n\n1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.\n\nSince in a circle of radius r , an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1\n\nradian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is l",
  "r radian. Thus, if in\n\na circle of radius r , an arc of length l subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have\n\nθ = l\n\nr or l = r θ.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n46\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\n3.2.3 Relation between radian and real numbers\n\nConsider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point\n\non the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.\n\nThen the length of an arc of the circle will give the radian\n\nmeasure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the\n\ncentre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is\n\ntangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the\n\nreal number zero, AP represents positive real number and\n\nAQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we\n\nrope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the\n\ncircle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real\n\nnumber will correspond to a radian measure and\n\nconversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can\n\nbe considered as one and the same.\n\n3.2.4 Relation between degree and radian Since a circle subtends at the centre\n\nan angle whose radian measure is 2 π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that\n\n2 π radian = 360°\n\nor\n\nπ radian = 180°\n\nThe above relation enables us to express a radian measure in terms of degree\n\nmeasure and a degree measure in terms of radian measure. Using approximate value\n\nof π as 22\n\n7 , we have\n\n1 radian = 180\n\nπ\n\n° = 57° 16 ′ approximately.\n\nAlso\n\n1° = π\n\n180 radian = 0.01746 radian approximately.\n\nThe relation between degree measures and radian measure of some common angles\n\nare given in the following table:\n\nA\n\nO\n\n1\n\nP\n\n1\n\n2\n\n− 1\n\n− 2\n\nQ\n\n0\n\nFig 3.5\n\nDegree\n\n30°\n\n45°\n\n60°\n\n90°\n\n180°\n\n270°\n\n360°\n\nRadian\n\nπ\n\n6\n\nπ\n\n4\n\nπ\n\n3\n\nπ\n\n2\n\nπ\n\n3 π\n\n2\n\n2 π\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 47",
  "Notational Convention\n\nSince angles are measured either in degrees or in radians, we adopt the convention\n\nthat whenever we write angle θ° , we mean the angle whose degree measure is θ and\n\nwhenever we write angle β , we mean the angle whose radian measure is β .\n\nNote that when an angle is expressed in radians, the word ‘radian’ is frequently\n\nomitted. Thus,\n\nπ\n\nπ\n\n180 and\n\n45\n\n4\n\n=\n\n°\n\n=\n\n° are written with the understanding that π and π\n\n4\n\nare radian measures. Thus, we can say that\n\nRadian measure = π\n\n180 × Degree measure\n\nDegree measure = 180\n\nπ × Radian measure\n\nExample 1 Convert 40° 20 ′ into radian measure.\n\nSolution We know that 180° = π radian.\n\nHence\n\n40° 20 ′ = 4 0 1\n\n3 degree = π\n\n180 × 121\n\n3 radian = 121 π\n\n540 radian.\n\nTherefore\n\n40° 20 ′ = 121 π\n\n540 radian.\n\nExample 2 Convert 6 radians into degree measure.\n\nSolution We know that π radian = 180°.\n\nHence\n\n6 radians = 180\n\nπ × 6 degree = 1080\n\n7\n\n22\n\n×\n\ndegree\n\n= 343 7\n\n11 degree\n\n= 343° + 7\n\n60\n\n11\n\n×\n\nminute [as 1° = 60 ′ ]\n\n= 343° + 38 ′ + 2\n\n11 minute\n\n[as 1 ′ = 60 ″ ]\n\n= 343° + 38 ′ + 10.9 ″\n\n= 343°38 ′ 11 ″ approximately.\n\nHence\n\n6 radians = 343° 38 ′ 11 ″ approximately.\n\nExample 3 Find the radius of the circle in which a central angle of 60° intercepts an\n\narc of length 37.4 cm (use\n\n22\n\nπ\n\n7\n\n=\n\n).\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n48\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\nSolution Here l = 37.4 cm and θ = 60° = 60 π\n\nπ\n\nradian =\n\n180\n\n3\n\nHence,\n\nby r = θ\n\nl , we have\n\nr = 37.4×3\n\n37.4×3×7\n\n=\n\nπ\n\n22\n\n= 35.7 cm\n\nExample 4 The minute hand of a watch is 1.5 cm long.

All angles which are integral multiples of π\n\n2 are called\n\nquadrantal angles . The coordinates of the points A, B, C and D are, respectively,\n\n(1, 0), (0, 1), (–1, 0) and (0, –1). Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have\n\ncos 0° = 1\n\nsin 0° = 0,\n\ncos π\n\n2 = 0\n\nsin π\n\n2 = 1\n\ncos π = − 1\n\nsin π = 0\n\ncos 3 π\n\n2\n\n= 0\n\nsin 3 π\n\n2\n\n= –1\n\ncos 2 π = 1\n\nsin 2 π = 0\n\nNow, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to\n\nsame point P. Thus, we also observe that if x increases (or decreases) by any integral\n\nmultiple of 2 π , the values of sine and cosine functions do not change. Thus,\n\nsin (2 n π + x ) = sin x , n ∈ Z , cos (2 n π + x ) = cos x , n ∈ Z\n\nFurther, sin x = 0, if x = 0, ± π, ± 2 π , ± 3 π , ..., i.e., when x is an integral multiple of π\n\nand cos x = 0, if x = ± π\n\n2 , ± 3 π\n\n2 , ± 5 π\n\n2 , ... i.e., cos x vanishes when x is an odd\n\nmultiple of π\n\n2 .

If ∠ AOQ = – x , then the\n\ncoordinates of the point Q will be ( a , – b )\n\n(Fig 3.7). Therefore\n\ncos (– x ) = cos x\n\nand\n\nsin (– x ) = – sin x\n\nSince for every point P ( a, b ) on\n\nthe unit circle, – 1 ≤ a ≤ 1 and\n\nFig 3.7\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\n52\n\nMATHEMATICS\n\n– 1 ≤ b ≤ 1, we have – 1 ≤ cos x ≤ 1 and –1 ≤ sin x ≤ 1 for all x . We have learnt in\n\nprevious classes that in the first quadrant (0 < x < π\n\n2 ) a and b are both positive, in the\n\nsecond quadrant ( π\n\n2 < x < π ) a is negative and b is positive, in the third quadrant\n\n( π < x < 3 π\n\n2 ) a and b are both negative and in the fourth quadrant ( 3 π\n\n2 < x < 2 π ) a is\n\npositive and b is negative. Therefore, sin x is positive for 0 < x < π , and negative for\n\nπ < x < 2 π . Similarly, cos x is positive for 0 < x < π\n\n2 , negative for π\n\n2 < x < 3 π\n\n2 and also\n\npositive for 3 π\n\n2 < x < 2 π . Likewise, we can find the signs of other trigonometric\n\nfunctions in different quadrants.

  "Historical Note\n\nThe study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian\n\nMathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and\n\nBhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from\n\nIndia to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the\n\nstudy of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian\n\napproach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.\n\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\n\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main\n\ncontribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of\n\nmathematics.\n\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\n\nfor angles more than 90 °. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\n\n(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for\n\nsines or cosines of 18 ° , 36 ° , 54 ° , 72 ° , etc., are given by\n\nBhaskara II.\n\nReprint 2025-26\n\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 75\n\n— v —\n\nThe symbols sin –1 x , cos –1 x , etc., for arc sin x , arc cos x , etc., were\n\nsuggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales\n\n(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He\n\nis credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by\n\nmeasuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known\n\nheight, and comparing the ratios:\n\nH\n\nS\n\nh\n\ns\n\n=\n\n= tan (sun’s altitude)\n\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through\n\nthe proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance\n\nusing the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.\n\nReprint 2025-26"
