  "The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words\n‘trigon’ and ‘metron’ and it means ‘measuring the sides of\na triangle’. The subject was originally developed to solve\ngeometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by\nsea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new\nlands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is\nused in many areas such as the science of seismology,\ndesigning electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,\npredicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a\nmusical tone and in many other areas.\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric\nratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of\ntrigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this\nChapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions\nand study their properties.\n",

If the direction of\nrotation is anticlockwise, the angle is said to be positive and if the direction of rotation\nis clockwise, then the angle is negative (Fig 3.1).\nThe measure of an angle is the amount of\nrotation performed to get the terminal side from\nthe initial side. There are several units for\nmeasuring angles. The definition of an angle\nsuggests a unit, viz. one complete revolution from the position of the initial side as\nindicated in Fig 3.2.\nThis is often convenient for large angles. For example, we can say that a rapidly\nspinning wheel is making an angle of say 15 revolution per second. We shall  describe\ntwo other units of measurement of an angle which are most commonly used, viz.\ndegree measure and radian measure.\n",

  "3.2.2  Radian measure  There is another unit for measurement of an angle, called\nthe radian measure. Angle subtended at the centre by an arc of length 1 unit in a\nunit circle (circle of radius 1 unit) is said to have a measure of 1 radian. In the Fig\n3.4(i) to (iv), OA is the initial side and OB is the terminal side. The figures show the\n\n\nangles whose measures are 1 radian, –1 radian, 1 1\n",
  "Fig  3.4 (i) to (iv)\n(iv)\n\n\nWe know that the circumference of a circle of radius 1 unit is 2π. Thus, one\ncomplete revolution of the initial side subtends an angle of  2π radian.\n\n\nMore generally, in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r will subtend an angle of\n",
  "1 radian. It is well-known that equal arcs of a circle subtend equal angle at the centre.\n",
  "Since in a circle of radius r, an arc of length r subtends an angle whose measure is 1\n\n\nradian, an arc of length l will subtend an angle whose measure is l\n\n\nr  radian. Thus, if in\n\n\na circle of radius r, an arc of length l subtends an angle θ radian at the centre, we have\n\n\nθ  = l\n\n\nr   or  l  = r θ.\n",
  "46\nMATHEMATICS\n\n\n3.2.3  Relation between radian and real numbers\nConsider the unit circle with centre O. Let A be any point\non the circle. Consider OA as initial side of an angle.\nThen the length  of an arc of the circle will give the radian\nmeasure of the angle which the arc will subtend at the\ncentre of the circle. Consider the line PAQ which is\ntangent to the circle at A. Let the point A represent the\nreal number zero, AP represents positive real number and\nAQ represents negative real numbers (Fig 3.5). If we\nrope the line AP in the anticlockwise direction along the\ncircle, and AQ in the clockwise direction, then every real\nnumber will correspond to a radian measure and\nconversely. Thus, radian measures and real numbers can\nbe considered as one and the same.\n\n\n3.2.4   Relation between degree and radian   Since a circle subtends at the centre\nan angle whose radian measure is 2π and its degree measure is 360°, it follows that\n",

  "Historical Note\n\n\nThe study of trigonometry was first started in India. The ancient Indian\nMathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and\nBhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from\nIndia to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the\nstudy of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian\napproach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main\ncontribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of\nmathematics.\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\nfor angles more than 90°. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\n(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for\nsines or cosines of 18°, 36°, 54°, 72°, etc., are given by\nBhaskara II.\n\n\nReprint 2025-26\n",

Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales\n(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He\nis credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by\nmeasuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known\nheight, and comparing the ratios:\n",
