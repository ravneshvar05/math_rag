vG eometry, as a logical system, is a means and even the most powerful
means to make children feel the strength of the human spirit that is
of their own spirit.  – H. FREUDENTHALv
9.1  Introduction
We are familiar with two-dimensional coordinate geometry
from earlier classes. Mainly, it is a combination of algebra
and geometry. A systematic study of geometry by the use
of algebra was first carried out by celebrated French
philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, in his book
‘La Géométry, published in 1637. This book introduced the
notion of the equation of a curve and related analytical
methods into the study of geometry. The resulting
combination of analysis and geometry is referred now as
analytical geometry. In the earlier classes, we initiated
the study of coordinate geometry, where we   studied about
coordinate axes, coordinate plane, plotting of points in a
plane, distance between two points, section formulae, etc. All these concepts are the
basics of coordinate geometry.

STRAIGHT LINES       153
The angle (say) θ made by the line l with positive
direction of x-axis and measured anti clockwise
is called the inclination of the line. Obviously
0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (Fig 9.2).
We observe that lines parallel to x-axis, or
coinciding with x-axis, have inclination of 0°. The
inclination of a vertical line (parallel to or
coinciding with y-axis) is 90°.
Definition 1 If θ is the inclination of a line
l, then tan θ is called the slope or gradient of
the line l.
The slope of a line whose inclination is 90° is not
defined.
The slope of a line is denoted by m.
Thus, m = tan θ, θ ≠ 90°
It may be observed that the slope of x-axis is zero and slope of y-axis is not defined.
9.2.1 Slope of a line when coordinates of any two points on the line are given
We know that a line is completely determined when we are given two points on it.
Hence, we proceed to find the slope of a
line in terms of the coordinates of two points
on the line.
Let P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) be two
points on n

Case II  When angle θ is obtuse:
In Fig 9.3 (ii), we have
 ∠MPQ = 180° –  θ.
Therefore,  θ = 180° – ∠MPQ.
Now, slope of the line l

9.2.2 Conditions for parallelism and perpendicularity of lines in terms of their
slopes In a coordinate plane, suppose that non-vertical lines l1 and l2 have slopes m1
and m2, respectively. Let their inclinations be α and
β, respectively.
If the line l1 is parallel to l2 (Fig 9.4), then their
inclinations are equal, i.e.,
α = β, and hence, tan α = tan β
Therefore
m1 = m2, i.e., their slopes are equal.
Conversely, if the slope of two lines l1 and l2
is same, i.e.,
m1 = m2.
Then
tan α = tan β.
By the property of tangent

Hence, two non vertical lines l1 and l2 are parallel if and only if their slopes
are equal.
If the lines l1 and l2 are perpendicular (Fig 9.5), then β = α + 90°.
Therefore, tan β = tan (α + 90°)
= – cot α =

i.e.,

or
m1  m2  = – 1
Conversely, if m1  m2  =  – 1, i.e., tan α tan β = – 1.
Then tan α = – cot β = tan (β + 90°) or tan (β – 90°)
Therefore,
α  and β differ by 90°.
Thus, lines l1 and l2 are perpendicular to each other.
Hence, two non-vertical lines are perpendicular to each other if and only if
their slopes are negative reciprocals of each other,
i.e.,
m2=

 or,  m1 m2 = – 1.

9.2.3 Angle between two lines When we think about more than one line in a plane,
then we find that these lines are either intersecting or parallel. Here we will discuss the
angle between two lines in terms of their slopes.
Let L1 and L2 be two non-vertical lines with slopes m1 and m2, respectively. If α1

We know that when two lines intersect each other, they make two pairs of
vertically opposite angles such that sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°. Let θ and
φ be the adjacent angles between the lines L1 and L2 (Fig 9.6). Then
θ = α2 – α1 and α1, α2  ≠ 90°.
Therefore  tan θ = tan (α2 – α1)
